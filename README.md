# Permutations
8380 Data Structure Project

This program offers:
1. square grid in which the permutation appears as a colored small square with inversions as colored x’s;
2. permutation’s inverse;
3. an inversion table;
4. permutation’s factoradic number;
5. permutation graph;
6. meanders, if possible for the permutation with documentation if not;
7. grid tours where the program generates and elucidates the generated extra permutation, for even length permutations; documented as not possible otherwise.
